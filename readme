I've decided to create a mini server to get some game data.
I'm quite passionate about games so let's see what I can make.

Found an end point with some gaming data.
Created a db.json file with the data.

The server reads the json file into an object and then the crud happens on the object.

CD into Back-End

`npm start`

To run this server you will need to use a program like postman or similar.
Ran out of time so couldn't do a front-end.

Displays all the games
http://localhost:5001/games

//Add a new game
http://localhost:5001/addgame

Headers: content-type: application/json

Body:
{
"appid": 101,
"name": "Disney Dreamlight Valley",
"playtime_forever": 0,
"img_icon_url": null,
"img_logo_url": null,
"has_community_visible_stats": true
}

Headers: content-type: application/jso
