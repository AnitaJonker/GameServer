I've decided to create a mini server to get some game data.
I'm quite passionate about games so let's see what I can make.

Found an end point with some gaming data.
Created a db.json file with the data.

The server reads the json file into an object and then the crud happens on the object.

CD into Back-End

`npm start`

To run this server you will need to use a program like postman or similar.
Ran out of time so couldn't do a front-end.

Displays all the games
http://localhost:5001/games

//Add a new game
http://localhost:5001/addgame

Headers: content-type: application/json

Body:
{
"appid": 101,
"name": "Disney Dreamlight Valley",
"playtime_forever": 0,
"img_icon_url": null,
"img_logo_url": null,
"has_community_visible_stats": true
}

Headers: content-type: application/jso
Edit game -- you need to provide the id and the body of the update you want to make

http://localhost:5001/userdet/240

{
"playtime_forever": 2890
}

Delete an element from file

-just need to provide the id

http://localhost:5001/userdelete/57300


I started with this project at about 18:00 I finished at 1 am.
I was motivated and assisted when I got stuck by my friend.
But the only piece of code I would attribute to them is the function 
deleteUserInfo()
I did end up editing it quite a bit but I value honesty and integrity quite highly.
They did brainstorm with me and helped me see it through.
I thrive in these kind of conditions where I get to code but I do have someone that can give me guidance when I get stuck.

Which is why I would love to join Terra Firma.
I know mentoring and training is a core value and it's what I'm looking for.
I had fun with this project.

Changes I would make:
I would like to get rid of the ForEach in the delete function.
And make use of an index of and split it directly.
But I ran out of time and I'd need to work with something that goes down to the next layer.
